In this assignment, I created a system by designing queries and implementing pre-defined
functions to operate on a database for a factory CengFactory. You will be provided with specific tasks
and a well-defined interface. This assignment aims to help getting familiar with connecting and querying
to MySQL Server using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC).

I first implemented functions that create the necessary tables corresponding to the schema given. 
Then, I designed queries to accomplish the given tasks. Lastly, I implemented
the interface using the queries I have designed as they give the desired results when defined parameters
are given.

# PA2
In this assignment I implemented a B+ tree to store book records. The primary B+ tree
will be setup using the bookID field. I only implemented certain operations, the following functionalities;

• Add Book: Adds a new book into the tree

• Search Book: Searches for a book with the given bookID, prints the visited nodes along the
path

• Print Tree: Prints the whole tree in depth first order, with proper indentation using tab
characters

I implemented these three operations based on the given input and made them print the necessary
output.
